# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repository demonstrates the use of Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of Hawaii. Then I designed a Flask API based on the queries in the climate analysis.

# Repository Structure
**SurfsUp:** Contains all files and resources for creating the Flask API and performing analysis.
  + **climate_analysis:** contains code using queries for weather analysis.
  + **app.py:** The file for using the Flas API.
  + **Resources Folder:** Contains the necessary sqlite file and the hawaii_measurements and hawaii_stations files for use in the analysis.
